- NLTK python used
- used stopwords from the nltk package
- the stopwords are in lower case so i added the .lower() and it removed about 4 more words.
- tokenzier for punc
- lemmatizer for stemming - exception that the lemmatizer defaults to noun only
- file in ascii and does not support unicode character set
