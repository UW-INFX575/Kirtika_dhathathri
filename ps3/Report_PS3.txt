1. Run LDA on a sample set
 lda_sample.py reads number of text documents to find the top 20 topics using python lda 
 library.

2.  Build a toy data set of text documents and relationships between the text documents
Files: document01-finance.txt, document02-finance.txt, document03-finance.txt, 
document04-ee.txt and document05-ee.txt were created using the following sources.

document01-finance: http://business.time.com/2013/10/10/why-we-want-but-cant-have-personal-finance-in-schools/
document02-finance: http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/articles/2012/10/09/why-most-high-schoolers-dont-know-how-to-manage-their-money
document03-finance:http://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/high-school-notes/2014/03/03/3-ways-to-engage-high-schoolers-in-personal-finance
document04-ee: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering
document05-ee: http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/electrical-and-electronics-engineers.htm

3.  Calculate the jargon distance between documents using the method in the Jargon Paper
jargonDist.py calculates the cultural holes across 2 different field documents.


4.  Calculate the jargon distance between documents using your own method
lda_test.py calculates the top 2 topics across the documents

5.  Compare methods (1-2 page paper) 
compare_methods.txt is the write up to explain the observations with results and comparison 
of the methods.
