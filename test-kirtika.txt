Assumptions and Design decisions:
- Scrapping data from UCSB with permission from ischool/jevin
- All Data scrapped from various departments from University of California, Santa Barbara
- id: sequential numbering
- FirstName: correct
- LastName: given the time constraint and differing name length, sometimes the middle name or middle initials might be present in place of lastname
- title: correct mostly. Rarely the name might create issues and so such examples will not show title
- school: hardcoded string
- dept: hardcoded string
- grad degree: script only looks for phd degree and adds that else it leaves blank
- grad school: script cmp exact match with schools.csv file, if the match fails (most cases) nothing is added else the uni id is added
- grad year: script finds the first digit in the text and adds it, assuming it has to be the degree recd year.


TODO:
- add grad_school varchar(200) and university varchar(200)
- graduation details in all dept except cs
	- sociology page has easy parsing 
- handle exceptions
- improve parsing and searching on parseGradInfo()
